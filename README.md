## Inspiration
Loika took inspiration from the modern trend of food produces. There has been a dramatic demand in locally, ecological produced food supply for everyday need as an average consumer is more conscious about the ingredients on their plates and its origins. Thanks to the internet, people are increasingly gaining awareness about the packaged overly process food and the pressure it brings to the health of the consumer in the long time, as well as the environment. It is only natural people are yearning for quality foods that they can rely on fully while relieve the amount of waste produced by industrial factories and the national scale transportation.
